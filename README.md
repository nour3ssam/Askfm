# Askfm
## Question and Answer System.
It is my first OOP project with C++, I tried to use some of the topics of OOP.
1. Classes and Objects.
2. Encapsulation.
3. Abstraction.
4. Constructor and Destructor.
5. Friend Functions and Classes.

## Features
#### 1.User Registration and Login:
Users can register with unique usernames and passwords.
#### 2.Asking Questions:
Registered users can ask questions to other users by specifying the recipient's username.
Questions are stored in the system by the sender's ID and recipient's ID.
#### 3.Answering Questions:
Users can view questions addressed to them and provide answers.
#### 4.Question Feeds:
The system provides a feed of questions, allowing users to view questions addressed to them or questions they have sent.


**NOTE**
- there is no data so try to insert some of it then try.

- Username consists of one string with no spaces.
